# hello-world
This is a trial. I have made another branch, readme-edits.
The branches, as the name suggests, are the copied documents. In addition to this, they also have changed commits.

The advantage of doing so is that, we can simultaneously make changes into the sister branch, without this branch being affected. And if desired, we can also merge the two branches.

Isn't it amazing ?
